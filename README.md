## About

### General Info

Snakebook is a simple single-player game. Players control
a yellow snake which is called Mr.Snake. For some weird 
reasons, in that morning, he woke up, found out he was shrunk then lost in a place full of worms
and mysterious risks. The objective of player is to help
Mr.Snake grow back to his original size by letting Mr.Snake eat books,
avoid eating "shit" or hitting worms and try to pass through obstacles.

### Rule
- Control Mr.Snake to let him eat the books in the area in order to increase size. But be careful with the “shit”! Eating it will decrease your size to half, you also die when your size is smaller than the beginning.
- On your journey, there are also obstacles and worms, try to avoid touching your head to those risks. You can kill worms by letting their heads touch your body. You can also kill worms by get them eat "shit", you can release "shit" while sprinting, eating "shit" will cause immediate death to the worm, the dead worm will transform into books.
- **Note**: After you die, scoring will be the number of books you ate. The circumstance where your head touches a worm's head also lets two of you die.

### Our Motivation

Our main motivation by choosing this game is to hope that we could finalize our first project game 
and extends our knowledge while learning through trial and error coding. We claimed that Snakebook is not a rip-off of Slither.io, we improvised the basic, easy-to-make-and-learn game with lots more features, though still keep it simple enough. Beside of that, this is a great chance for us to know how to team-work and lay the foundation for our future, 
step by step from junior developer, grinding and become senior leadership someday. Moreover, eating books and being called Snakebook is a play-word for bookworm, snake got lost with bunches of worms is kind of funny and amused.
